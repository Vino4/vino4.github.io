window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“One of the best books I’ve ever read on men’s emotional health and development.” Mark Manson, author of <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> and <i>Models</i>.</p> <p>“I have read every self-help book out there, but this was the first that put everything together in a way that made perfect sense to me.”</p> <p>“Every page of my copy of <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> is highlighted in yellow. How did you know me so well?</p> <p>A Nice Guy, according to Dr. Robert Glover, a pioneering expert on the Nice Guy Syndrome, is a man who believes he is not okay just as he is. He is convinced that he must become what he <i>thinks</i> others want him to be liked, loved, and get his needs met. He also believes that he must hide anything about himself that might trigger a negative response in others.</p> <p>The Nice Guy Syndrome typically begins in infancy and childhood when a young boy inaccurately internalizes emotional messages about himself and the world. It is fueled by toxic shame and anxiety. Rapid social change in the late 20th century and early 21st century has contributed to a worldwide explosion of men struggling to find happiness, love, and purpose.</p> <p>The paradigm of the Nice Guy Syndrome is driven by three faulty <i>covert contracts</i>. Nice Guys believe:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>If I am <i>good</i>, then I will be liked and loved.</li> <li>If I meet other people’s needs without them having to ask, then they will meet my needs without me having to ask.</li> <li>If I do everything <i>right</i>, then I will have a smooth, problem-free life.</li> </ul> <p>The inauthentic and chameleon-like approach to life causes Nice Guys to often feel frustrated, confused, and resentful. Subsequently, these men are often anything but <i>nice</i>. Common Nice Guy patterns include giving to get, difficulty setting boundaries, dishonesty, caretaking, fixing, codependency, people-pleasing, conflict avoidance, passive-aggressiveness, unsatisfying relationships, issues with sexuality, and compulsive masturbation and pornography use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Since the publication of <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> in 2003, hundreds of thousands of men worldwide have learned how to release toxic shame, soothe their anxiety, face their fears, connect with men, embrace their passion and purpose, and experience success in work and career. These men have also learned to set boundaries, handle conflict, make their needs a priority, develop satisfying relationships, and experience great sex.</p> <p>This process of recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome allows men to move through:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Depression</li> <li>Social anxiety and shyness</li> <li>Codependency</li> <li>Low self-esteem</li> <li>Loneliness and hopelessness</li> <li>Feelings of failure</li> <li>Lack of confidence and purpose</li> <li>Compulsive behaviors and addictions</li> <li>Feeling stuck in life</li> </ul> <p>Contrary to what the title might seem to imply, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> does not teach men how to be <i>not nice</i>. Dr. Glover shows men how to become what he calls <i>Integrated Males</i>. Becoming integrated does not mean becoming different or better. It means being able to accept all aspects of oneself. An integrated male can embrace everything that makes him unique - his power, his assertiveness, his humor, his courage, and his mission, as well as his fears, his imperfections, his mistakes, his rough edges, and his dark side.</p> <p>If you are ready to get what you want in love, sex, and life, <i>No More Mr. Nice Guy</i> will show you how.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
