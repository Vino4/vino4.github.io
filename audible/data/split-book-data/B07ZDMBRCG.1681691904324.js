Sure, sales cycles were long and acquisition was expensive, but that’s how everybody grew their companies.</p> <p>But after I helped launch a freemium product that went from 0-100K users in less than 12 months, I realized the traditional way of selling software was deeply flawed.</p> <p>Hi, I’m Wes Bush, founder of the Product-Led Institute. And in <i>Product-Led Growth</i>, I show you how you can cut your acquisition costs and scale further than you ever thought possible...by making your product the tool that helps you acquire, convert, and retain customers.</p> <p>But what does it mean to be \"product-led\"? How do you know if a product-led growth strategy makes sense for your business? And most importantly, how do you execute it?</p> <p>You’ll find answers to all of these questions inside this audiobook.
