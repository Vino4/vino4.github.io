window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Personal Development, 2013</b></p> <p><i>It Worked for Me</i> is filled with vivid experiences and lessons learned that have shaped the legendary career of the four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. At its heart are Powell's \"Thirteen Rules\" - such as \"Get mad, then get over it\" and \"Share credit\" - that introduce his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others. </p> <p>A natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. \"Trust your people,\" he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. \"Do your best - someone is watching,\" he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage job mopping floors in a factory. </p> <p>Powell combines the insight he gained in the military and four presidential administrations with lessons from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx and his training in the ROTC. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for everyone he works with. </p> <p>A brilliant and original blueprint for leadership, Colin Powell's <i>It Worked for Me</i> is bound to inspire, move, and surprise readers. </p> <p>Includes an interview with the author.</p>";
