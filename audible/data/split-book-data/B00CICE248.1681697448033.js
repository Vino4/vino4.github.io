But by knowing what they are and how to identify them, we can avoid them and make better choices: Whether in dealing with personal problems or business negotiations, trying to save money or earn profits, or merely working out what we really want in life - and strategizing the best way to get it. </p> <p>Already an international bestseller, <i>The Art of Thinking Clearly</i> distills cutting-edge research from behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience into a clever, practical guide for anyone who's ever wanted to be wiser and make better decisions. A novelist, thinker, and entrepreneur, Rolf Dobelli deftly shows that in order to lead happier, more prosperous lives, we don't need extra cunning, new ideas, shiny gadgets, or more frantic hyperactivity - all we need is less irrationality. </p> <p>Simple, clear, and always surprising, this indispensable audiobook will change the way you think and transform your decision making - at work, at home, every day. From why you shouldn't accept a free drink to why you should walk out of a movie you don't like, from why it's so hard to predict the future to why you shouldn't watch the news, <i>The Art of Thinking Clearly</i> helps solve the puzzle of human reasoning. </p>";
